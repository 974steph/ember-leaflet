<h1 class="doc-page-title">Installation</h1>

<p>
  Ember-leaflet is packaged as an <a href="http://www.ember-cli.com/">Ember-cli</a> addon. As usual,
  the only thing you need to do is to run an install command in your ember app directory:
</p>

{{#code-block}}$ ember install ember-leaflet{{/code-block}}

<p>
  This command installed all ember-leaflet components and leaflet itself, along with its styles and assets.
  You're ready to map!
